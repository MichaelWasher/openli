.SH NAME
openli-collector \- collector daemon for OpenLI

.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBopenlicollector\fR \fB-c\fR \fIconfigfile\fR [\fB-hd\fR] [\fB-p \fIpidfile\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBopenli-collector\fR is the collector component of the \fBOpenLI\fR
lawful interception system. More specifically, the collector is used to
capture packets on one or more interceptable interfaces, determine which
packets should be intercepted, encode those packets using the ETSI LI
format and forward the encoded packets onto an OpenLI mediator.

Show summary of supported command-line options

.TP
\fB-c, --config \fIconfigfile\fR
Specifies the location of the file containing the configuration to
use when running this openli-collector instance. See CollectorDoc.md
(most likely installed in /usr/share/doc/openli) for details on the
configuration file format.

.TP
\fB-d, --daemonise\fR
Run the openli-collector as a detached daemon.

.TP
\fB-p, --pidfile \fIpidfile\fR

.SH SECURITY
Although \fBopenli-collector\fR can run unpriviliged, most intercept
scenarios will require root privileges to perform raw packet capture on
a network interface.
