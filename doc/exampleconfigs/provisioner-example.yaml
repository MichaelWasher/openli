# List the set of agencies that we can perform intercepts for
agencies:

 - agencyid: "Police"           # id must be unique per agency
   hi2address: 192.168.200.1    # address of the HI2 service at the agency
   hi2port: 35530               # port number of the HI2 service at the agency
   hi3address: 192.168.200.1    # address of the HI3 service at the agency
   hi3port: 35531               # port number of the HI3 service at the agency

 - agencyid: "Spooks"           # id must be unique per agency
   hi2address: 10.10.1.1        # address of the HI2 service at the agency
   hi2port: 7001                # port number of the HI2 service at the agency
   hi3address: 10.10.1.2        # address of the HI3 service at the agency
   hi3port: 18888               # port number of the HI3 service at the agency
   requirekaresponse: no        # keep the handovers going, even if the agency
                                # fails to respond to our keepalives.


# List of active IP intercepts.
# To change intercepts for a running OpenLI process, modify the intercept list
# in the config file, then send a SIGHUP to the provisioner process.
#
# In this example, we have two IP intercepts running: one for the "Police"
# intercepting all IP traffic for the user 'imacriminal' and one for the
# "Spooks" that is translating an Alcatel-Lucent native intercept into an
# ETSI-compliant one. For the latter, all ALU intercept packets with an
# Intercept ID of 522781 will be converted to have the ETSI LIID of NAPP9321HN
# and the resulting records will be forwarded to the "Spooks" agency.

# List of active VOIP intercepts.
# To change intercepts for a running OpenLI process, modify the intercept list
# in the config file, then send a SIGHUP to the provisioner process.
#
# In this example, we have two VOIP intercepts running: one for the "Police"
# intercepting VOIP calls for 'badguy@myisp.com' and one for the "Spooks"
# intercepting VOIP calls for 'target@myisp.com'.
# Both intercepts will be routed to the agencies via the mediator that is
# configured with the ID 6001.
